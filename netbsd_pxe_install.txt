How to install NetBSD on a box with only a PXE boot capable NIC, keyboard,
monitor, and a FreeBSD router.

This was tested on FreeBSD 7.0 trying to install NetBSD 5.0.2. This process was
adapted from http://bsdsupport.org/2007/01/netbsd-pxe-boot-install-without-nfs/

* Download the necessary NetBSD boot loader and kernel:

  # wget ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-5.0.2/amd64/installation/misc/pxeboot_ia32.bin
  # wget ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-5.0.2/amd64/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz

* Create directory to serve NetBSD, extract the kernel, and copy it and the
  boot loader there:

  # mkdir /tftpboot
  # gunzip netbsd-INSTALL.gz
  # cp netbsd-INSTALL /tftpboot
  # cp pxeboot_ia32.bin /tftpboot

* ``inetd`` and ``dhcpd`` need to be enabled, so add (or uncomment) these lines
  in ``/etc/rc.conf``:

  inetd_enable="YES"
  dhcpd_enable="YES"

* Allow ``inetd`` to start up ``tftpd`` when it gets requests by uncommenting
  the line in ``/etc/inetd.conf`` that looks like:

  tftp dgram udp wait root /usr/libexec/tftpd tftpd -l  -s /tftpboot

* Configure ``dhcpd`` to serve ``pxeboot_ia32.bin`` by making your
  ``/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf`` file look like the following. This
  configuration assumes that the FreeBSD box has IP 192.168.0.1 and is running
  all of the services (dhcp and tftp). If the tftp server is on a different
  server then you should change the value of ``next-server`` appropriately.
  Also, if the dhcp server is not the router for the network you can change the
  value of ``option routers``.

  # option definitions common to all supported networks...
  option domain-name "domain.local";
  option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1, 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;

  default-lease-time 3600;
  max-lease-time 86400;

  # If this DHCP server is the official DHCP server for the local
  # network, the authoritative directive should be uncommented.
  authoritative;

  # ad-hoc DNS update scheme - set to "none" to disable dynamic DNS updates.
  ddns-update-style none;

  # Use this to send dhcp log messages to a different log file (you also
  # have to hack syslog.conf to complete the redirection).
  log-facility local7;

  subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      range 192.168.0.150 192.168.0.200;
      option routers 192.168.0.1;
      next-server 192.168.0.1;
      option root-path "/tftpboot";
      filename "/pxeboot_ia32.bin";
  }

* Now you need to restart (or start) ``inetd`` and ``dhcpd``:

  # /etc/rc.d/inetd restart
  # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd restart

* Now you can fire up the target box. As it attempts to PXE boot, your dhcpd
  server will send it ``pxeboot_ia32.bin``, the target box will run it and
  attempt to load the NetBSD kernel -- but you must abort this by pressing some
  key (other than enter/return). Once aborted you should be dropped to a
  bootloader prompt where you want to give the command to boot from the kernel
  being served by your tftp server:

  > boot tftp:netbsd-INSTALL

* At this point you will be booted into the typical NetBSD installation process.
